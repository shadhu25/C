    consider the following declation of two dimention array in C
                            char a[100][100]
    assuming that the main memory is byte addressable and that the array is
    stored starting from the memory address 0, the address of a[40][50] is:
    
        a) 4040
        b) 4050
        c) 5040
        d) 5050
