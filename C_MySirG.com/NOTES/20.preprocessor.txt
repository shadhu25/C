Pre-processor
    Pre-processor is a program which performs before the compilation.
    Pre-processor only notices # started statement
    # is called pre-processor directive
    Each pre-processing directive must be on its own line.
    the word after # is called pre-processeor command
#include
    include is one of the most popular pre- processeor command
    It can be used include any file content to ypur source file

    #include<file_name or path>
    #include"file_name or path"
    this is wrong #include</media/shadhu/94986C41986C2448/studyMetarials/languageCode/C/c(saurabhshukla)/20.2preprocessor.c>
    this is write #include"/media/shadhu/94986C41986C2448/studyMetarials/languageCode/C/c(saurabhshukla)/20.2preprocessor.c"
#define
    The #define directive defines an identifier and a character sequence ( a set of charectors ) that will be subtituted for the identifier each time it is encountered in the source file.
    #define macro-name char-sequence
    #define PI 3.14
    #define SUM(a,b) a+b
#undef
    It is used to undifined macros
    #undef PI
#if, #else, #elif, #endif
    As a file being compiled, you can use these commands to cause certain lines of code to be included or not included (for compilation)
#ifdef
    If the macro has been defined by a #define statement, then the code immediately following the command will be compiled 
#ifundef
    If the macro has not been defined by a #define statement, then the code immediately following the command will be compilled.
