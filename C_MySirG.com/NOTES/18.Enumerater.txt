Enumerator
    It gives an opportunity to invent own data type and define what values the variable of this data type can take.

enum monts{
    jan=1, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec
};

jan=1  and dec=10

Internally, compiler treats the enumerators as integers.
you can write any program in C language without the help of enumerators but, enumerators helps in writing clear codes and simplify programming
